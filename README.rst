--------
Creating a tool which will be able to create create plots or graphs of the commit history of any git repo which will be entered by the user

TOOLS TO BE USED
-----------------
- GitPython
- matplotlib
- python-prettytable

DESCRIPTION
------------
At first I'm just working on creating a table-wise output rather than plots or graphs. I'm using the library python-prettytable for that. Later when I'll be creating the plots or graphs by using matplotlib, after I'm done with discovering the algo for extracting the correct information from the given repository
GitPython will be the whole means by which I'll be getting all the information needed
python-prettytable will be used to present the data in well-structured tabular form
matplotlib will do the final job of creating the necessary plots.
